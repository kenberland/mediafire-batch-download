I used this to download a bunch of mp3's from mediafire. They say you can upgrade your account, but that doesn't really work because then you get redirected off the page you want to your "home." I dowloaded a bunch, and then they captcha'd me. I had upgraded and cancelled but my account was still active, so I tried again with a logged-in cookie and that worked. I was able to get all the files. So, this might cost you $5, but at least you can recursively get the stuff. You might try and throttle without a logged-in cookie or get some more IPs from AWS.

You need ruby and bundler. Then just bundle and run.
